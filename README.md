# Realistic Damage Model. Mod for both the original XCOM:EW and the mod Long War

The higher the accuracy is – the higher the damage is. But don’t relax: there is always a chance of maximum damage.

The problem of original game is that the covers are pretty much useless because too often the aliens kill the gamer’s soldiers, who stand behind the full cover. Every third shot kills the covered soldier. It is tiring, uninteresting and unrealistic. Because the hit doesn’t always have to be into the head or the heart. Gamers’ soldiers also have arms and legs just like aliens. Besides, the shot can give a scratch. And if you hit the heel – there is no way that damage can be great.  With a low accuracy (when your hands are shaking, or the opponent’s silhouette is fuzzy) the probability of hitting the vital part of the body is the lowest – at the level of luck.

This mod fixes the mentioned problem. Now the size of the damage depends on the accuracy of the produced shot. The higher the accuracy is - the greater the damage of a successful hit will be. Particularly, this means that if a player is lucky and his soldier made a good reaction shot with 30% accuracy - the alien is unlikely to die, and can freely put their evil deeds into practice. However, there is always a little chance that the shot will hit vital point, and will cause the maximum possible damage. So you will not get bored. Especially on the higher levels of difficulty, where the accuracy of aliens' shots increases.

This mod is compatible with both the original game and the mod Long War.

The screenshots show the results of mod work.

Also, for clarity – there are some charts which show the resulting scatter of hits at a certain precision shot. Each graph is the result of emulation of hundreds of random shots at a fixed precision. The vertical axis for each shot is a percentage of the original damage that the victim will get, if the shot does hit the target.
